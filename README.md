# Project M
Song transcription client

Download the jarfile called ProjectM.jar and run "java -jar ProjectM.jar" or double click on the file to run it. It will generate a few files in the same directory as it is placed. Command line is preferred so you can see the debug messages - otherwise it looks like the program has stalled.

Choose a song and wait quietly - the computer will be capturing sound from its mic, and then it will be processing the data - it will take a while. Make sure you take off any headphones and play at full volume so that the computer can hear the music. You can also redirect the output sound directly into the input mic, as we have done on our computers, to avoid all ambient noise.

After about 30 seconds, an accurate score will be produced.
